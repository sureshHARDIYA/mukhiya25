# Supabase Authentication Implementation

This document describes the proper Supabase authentication implementation for the Next.js portfolio chatbot project.

## Overview

We have successfully implemented Supabase authentication following the official Next.js documentation, replacing the simple authentication system with a robust, database-backed authentication solution.

## Architecture

### 1. Supabase Client Utilities

**Client-side (`utils/supabase/client.ts`)**
- Used for Client Components that run in the browser
- Handles authentication state management on the client

**Server-side (`utils/supabase/server.ts`)**
- Used for Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers
- Handles cookie-based authentication
- Properly manages session refresh

**Middleware (`utils/supabase/middleware.ts`)**
- Refreshes authentication tokens automatically
- Manages cookie state between client and server
- Ensures authenticated sessions are maintained

### 2. Authentication Flow

**Login System (`app/login/`)**
- `page.tsx`: Login form with email/password
- `actions.ts`: Server actions for login and signup
- Supports both sign-in and sign-up from the same form

**Route Protection**
- Middleware (`middleware.ts`) protects routes automatically
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Excludes public routes (home, API, auth, error pages)

**Auth Confirmation (`app/auth/confirm/`)**
- Handles email confirmation links
- Verifies OTP tokens for account activation

**Logout System (`app/auth/logout/`)**
- Server action for secure logout
- Clears authentication cookies
- Redirects to login page

### 3. Admin Interface Integration

**Protected Admin Route (`app/admin/page.tsx`)**
- Server Component that checks authentication
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Passes user data to client components

**Admin Dashboard Client (`components/admin/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`)**
- Client Component for interactive features
- Displays user email in the interface
- Handles logout functionality

**Skills Manager**
- Updated to use proper Supabase client
- Connects to database with authenticated requests
- Handles CRUD operations securely

## Database Integration

### Tables Created
- `skills`: Portfolio skills with categories and levels
- `education`: Educational background
- `experience`: Work experience
- `projects`: Portfolio projects
- `research`: Research publications
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies enabled

### Authentication Features
- Email/password authentication
- Automatic session management
- Secure cookie handling
- Token refresh mechanism
- Protected API routes

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Key Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all tables
2. **Server-side Authentication**: Uses `getUser()` for reliable auth checks
3. **Automatic Token Refresh**: Middleware handles session management
4. **Protected Routes**: Middleware redirects unauthenticated users
5. **Secure Logout**: Server actions clear all authentication state

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to `/admin` to access the admin interface
2. If not authenticated, you'll be redirected to `/login`
3. Sign up or sign in with email/password
4. Access the full admin dashboard with skills management

### For Developers
1. Use `createClient()` from `@/utils/supabase/client` in Client Components
2. Use `createClient()` from `@/utils/supabase/server` in Server Components
3. Authentication state is automatically managed
4. Add new protected routes by default (middleware handles it)

## Migration from Simple Auth

The simple authentication system has been completely replaced with:
- Database-backed user accounts instead of hardcoded credentials
- Proper session management instead of localStorage
- Server-side route protection instead of client-side checks
- Secure logout instead of simple state reset

## Testing

1. **Access Control**: Try accessing `/admin` without authentication → redirects to `/login`
2. **Login Flow**: Create account or sign in → access admin dashboard
3. **Session Persistence**: Refresh page → stay logged in
4. **Logout**: Click logout → redirected to login, session cleared
5. **Public Routes**: Home page accessible without authentication

## Next Steps

1. Set up email templates in Supabase dashboard for user confirmation
2. Configure password reset functionality
3. Add social authentication providers if needed
4. Implement role-based access control for different admin levels
5. Add user profile management features

This implementation provides a production-ready authentication system that scales with your application needs while maintaining security best practices.
